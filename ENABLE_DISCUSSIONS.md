# Enable GitHub Discussions - Quick Guide

## Why Enable Discussions?

Since npm package pages don't support comments, GitHub Discussions becomes your primary community engagement channel where users can:
- Ask questions
- Share use cases
- Provide feedback
- Discuss features
- Help each other

## How to Enable (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/s8ken/SYMBI-Symphony/settings
2. Scroll to the "Features" section
3. Check the box next to "Discussions"
4. Click "Set up discussions"

### Step 2: Create Welcome Discussion
GitHub will create an initial welcome post. Edit it to say:

```markdown
# Welcome to SYMBI Symphony Discussions! 🎉

### Step 3: Create Initial Discussions

Create 2-3 seed discussions to get started:

**Discussion 1: "Introduce Yourself 👋"**
```markdown
Hi everyone!

Welcome to the SYMBI Symphony community. I'd love to hear:

1. What brought you to SYMBI Symphony?
2. What are you building with AI agents?
3. What trust/identity challenges are you facing?

I'll start:

I'm Stephen, solo founder who built SYMBI Symphony over 7 months with zero dev background. I was deep in the AI agent space and noticed agents couldn't prove identity, verify credentials, or maintain audit trails. Built this to solve that problem.

Now applying to YC and excited to see what the community builds!

Your turn 👇
```

**Discussion 2: "What's Your Use Case? 🎯"**
```markdown
Curious what everyone is building with SYMBI Symphony!

Share:
- What problem are you solving?
- Which features are you using? (DID resolution, VCs, revocation, audit trails)
- What's been most useful?
- What's missing?

This helps me prioritize roadmap items.

Some example use cases I'm aware of:
- Multi-agent trust networks
- EU AI Act compliance
- Enterprise AI governance
- Decentralized identity systems

What's yours?
```

**Discussion 3: "Roadmap Feedback: What Should We Build Next? 🗺️"**
```markdown
SYMBI Symphony v0.1.0 is live! Now planning v0.2.0 and beyond.

Current roadmap: https://github.com/s8ken/SYMBI-Symphony#-roadmap

**Q1 2026 candidates:**
- Additional DID methods (did:pkh, did:peer)
- W3C VC Data Model 2.0 support
- Credential exchange protocols (DIDComm, WACI)
- GraphQL API
- Performance optimizations
- Multi-language SDKs (Python, Go, Rust)

**What's most important to YOU?**

Vote with 👍 or comment with your priorities!
```

## Step 4: Add Discussion Link to README

Update your README.md to highlight discussions:

```markdown
