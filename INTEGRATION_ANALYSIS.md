# SYMBI Vault & Tactical Command Integration Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive integration plan for connecting SYMBI Vault's trust infrastructure with Tactical Command's operational interface, creating a unified AI trust and orchestration platform.

## Current Architecture Assessment

### SYMBI Vault Components
- **TrustOracle**: JavaScript implementation for evaluating 7 constitutional AI articles
- **TrustBond Model**: Mongoose schema for human-AI trust relationships
- **Trust Scoring**: Compliance and guilt scoring mechanisms
- **Research Framework**: Academic materials and replication kits

### Tactical Command Components
- **SymbiIntegrationService**: Agent network management service
- **6 Specialized Agents**: Intelligence Analyst, Cybersecurity Sentinel, Field Commander, etc.
- **Next.js Interface**: Production-ready web application
- **Bridge API**: Connection to AgentVerse multi-agent environment

### Symphony Core Components
- **SymbiOrchestrator**: Central agent coordination system
- **Agent Factory**: Template-based agent creation
- **Trust Infrastructure**: DID resolution, VCs, revocation, audit trails

## Integration Gaps Identified

### 1. Trust Infrastructure Disconnect
- Vault's TrustOracle not integrated with Tactical Command
- Trust scoring system isolated from operational interface
- No constitutional compliance checking in agent operations

### 2. Agent Orchestration Fragmentation
- Symphony orchestrator not connected to Tactical's agent network
- Duplicate agent management systems
- No unified message routing between components

### 3. Data Flow Inconsistencies
- Trust state declarations not synchronized
- Audit trails fragmented across systems
- No unified dashboard for trust and operations

## Integration Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Trust Infrastructure Integration

#### 1.1 TrustOracle Bridge Service
```typescript
// Location: src/integration/trust-oracle-bridge.ts
export class TrustOracleBridge {
  async evaluateAgentAction(context: TrustContext): Promise<TrustResult>
  async updateAgentTrustScore(agentId: string, evaluation: TrustResult): Promise<void>
  async getConstitutionalCompliance(agentId: string): Promise<ComplianceReport>
}
```

#### 1.2 Trust Scoring Integration
- Connect Vault's trust scoring to Tactical's agent management
- Real-time trust score updates in agent dashboard
- Constitutional compliance indicators

#### 1.3 Audit Trail Unification
- Merge Symphony audit trails with Vault trust evaluations
- Centralized logging service for all trust interactions
- Tamper-evident recording of compliance violations

### Phase 2: Agent Orchestration Integration

#### 2.1 Unified Agent Management
```typescript
// Location: src/integration/unified-agent-orchestrator.ts
export class UnifiedAgentOrchestrator {
  private symphonyOrchestrator: SymbiOrchestrator
  private tacticalService: SymbiIntegrationService
  
  async registerUnifiedAgent(config: UnifiedAgentConfig): Promise<void>
  async routeMessage(message: UnifiedMessage): Promise<void>
  async executeTrustValidatedTask(task: TrustValidatedTask): Promise<TaskResult>
}
```

#### 2.2 Message Routing Enhancement
- Connect Symphony's message bus with Tactical's SymbiIntegrationService
- Trust-validated message routing between agents
- Policy enforcement across all agent communications

#### 2.3 Capability-Based Assignment
- Map Symphony agent capabilities to Tactical agent specs
- Dynamic agent assignment based on trust scores
- Compliance-aware task distribution

### Phase 3: Unified Interface Integration

#### 3.1 Enhanced Trust Dashboard
```typescript
// Location: Tactical Command/components/trust/UnifiedTrustDashboard.tsx
export default function UnifiedTrustDashboard() {
  // Real-time trust scores from Vault
  // Agent compliance status from Symphony
  // Operational metrics from Tactical
}
```

#### 3.2 Constitutional Compliance Interface
- TrustOracle evaluation results in operational dashboard
- Real-time compliance monitoring for all agents
- Violation alerts and remediation workflows

#### 3.3 Integrated Audit Console
- Unified view of all trust and operational events
- Filtering by agent, trust level, compliance status
- Export capabilities for regulatory reporting

```

### API Integration Points
1. **Trust Evaluation API**: `/api/trust/evaluate`
2. **Agent Registration API**: `/api/agents/register-unified`
3. **Compliance Monitoring API**: `/api/compliance/monitor`
4. **Unified Audit API**: `/api/audit/unified`

### Data Synchronization
- **Trust State**: Real-time sync between Vault declarations and Tactical display
- **Agent Status**: Bi-directional sync between Symphony orchestrator and Tactical agents
- **Audit Events**: Stream processing for unified audit trail

## Implementation Timeline
