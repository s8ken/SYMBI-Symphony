### Maker Profile Bio
Solo founder building trust infrastructure for AI. Zero dev background → production-grade W3C compliance in 7 months. YC applicant. Believer in verifiable, transparent AI systems.

### First Comment (Launch Strategy)
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Stephen, and I built SYMBI Symphony over the past 7 months as a solo founder with zero dev background.

**Why I Built This:**

I've been deep in the AI agent space and noticed a critical gap: agents can't prove who they are, verify credentials, or maintain audit trails. This creates trust problems that block enterprise adoption and EU AI Act compliance.

SYMBI Symphony is the first production-ready solution for this. It's built on W3C standards (DID Core, VC Data Model, Status List 2021), fully tested (95 tests, 95.3% coverage), and ready for production.

**What Makes It Different:**

1. **No Blockchain Required** - Works with DNS-based DIDs (though supports blockchain if you want)
2. **Privacy-Preserving** - Revocation checks don't reveal which credential you're checking
3. **Standards-Based** - Built on open W3C standards, not proprietary tech
4. **Production-Ready** - 313+ tests, RFC/NIST validation, enterprise KMS
5. **EU AI Act Compliant** - Transparency, auditability, human oversight built-in

**Try It Yourself:**

```bash
npm install @yseeku/trust-protocol
```

Or check out the live demo: https://symbi-synergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app

**Open Questions for the Community:**

1. What trust challenges are you facing with AI agents?
2. Should we prioritize more DID methods or focus on performance?
3. What compliance frameworks do you need support for?

Happy to answer any questions about the architecture, standards, or implementation!

## 🟠 Hacker News Launch

### Show HN Post Title
**Show HN: SYMBI Symphony – W3C Trust Infrastructure for AI Agents**

### Post Body

I've been working on trust infrastructure for AI agents for the past 7 months, and I'm excited to share SYMBI Symphony with the HN community.

**What Is It?**

SYMBI Symphony is a production-ready trust protocol for AI agents, providing:

- Decentralized Identity (DID) - 4 methods: did:web, did:key, did:ethr, did:ion
- Verifiable Credentials (VC) - 6-pillar trust scoring
- Privacy-Preserving Revocation - W3C Status List 2021 (128K credentials → 16KB)
- Enterprise Key Management - AWS KMS, GCP KMS, Local
- Cryptographic Audit Trails - Tamper-evident, blockchain-style chaining

**Why Build This?**

AI agent ecosystems have a fundamental problem: no way to prove identity, verify trust, or maintain audit trails. This blocks enterprise adoption and creates compliance nightmares (especially with the EU AI Act coming).

I couldn't find a production-ready solution that:
1. Was standards-based (W3C DID Core, VC Data Model)
2. Didn't require blockchain for basic functionality
3. Had privacy-preserving revocation
4. Was actually tested and validated

So I built one.

**Technical Highlights:**

- 95 tests passing, 95.3% coverage
- RFC 8032 (Ed25519), RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization), NIST CAVP validated
- <50ms DID resolution, <5ms trust scoring, <1ms revocation checks
- TypeScript with strict mode, 313+ test files
- Zero dependencies for core crypto (validation against known test vectors)

**Design Decisions:**

1. **No Blockchain Required**: You can use did:web (DNS-based) for basic functionality. Blockchain DIDs (did:ethr, did:ion) are optional.

2. **Privacy-Preserving Revocation**: Status List 2021 uses bitstring compression. You can check if a credential is revoked without revealing which credential you're checking.

3. **Standards-First**: Built on W3C standards, not proprietary protocols. This ensures interoperability and long-term viability.

4. **KMS-Backed Cryptography**: All signatures use enterprise key management (AWS KMS, GCP KMS) for production deployments. No keys in memory.

**Interesting Technical Challenges:**

- Implementing W3C Status List 2021 with GZIP compression (87.5% size reduction)
- Multi-method DID resolution with caching and fallback
- Cryptographic audit trails that scale to 10M+ entries
- Type-safe wrappers around AWS/GCP KMS APIs

**Known Limitations:**

- Currently Node.js/TypeScript only (Python, Go, Rust on roadmap)
- Some tests require environment variables (working on auto-configuration)
- Documentation could be better (it's on the roadmap)

**Repository**: https://github.com/s8ken/SYMBI-Symphony

**NPM**: `npm install @yseeku/trust-protocol`

**Live Demo**: https://symbi-synergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app

I'm applying this to YC's current batch and would love feedback from the HN community. What trust challenges are you facing with AI systems?

Happy to answer questions about the architecture, cryptography, or implementation!

### LinkedIn Announcement

🚀 **Launching SYMBI Symphony v0.1.0 - W3C Trust Infrastructure for AI Agents**

After 7 months of intense development as a solo founder with zero dev background, I'm excited to announce the public launch of SYMBI Symphony - the first production-ready trust infrastructure for decentralized AI agent systems.

**The Problem:**

As AI agents become more autonomous and interconnected, enterprises face a critical trust gap:
- No way to verify agent identity
- No portable trust credentials
- Privacy leaks on revocation checks
- No cryptographic audit trails
- Compliance challenges (EU AI Act, GDPR)

These aren't minor issues - they're blocking enterprise AI adoption.

**The Solution:**

SYMBI Symphony provides 6 core capabilities based on W3C standards:

🆔 **Decentralized Identity (DID)** - 4 methods supporting multi-chain, DNS-based, and purely cryptographic identities
📜 **Verifiable Credentials (VC)** - 6-pillar trust scoring system with quantifiable metrics
🔒 **Privacy-Preserving Revocation** - W3C Status List 2021 (128K credentials compressed to 16KB)
🔑 **Enterprise Key Management** - AWS KMS, GCP KMS with HSM-backed signing
🔗 **Cryptographic Audit Trails** - Blockchain-style chaining, tamper-evident
📊 **Real-Time Transparency** - Dune Analytics dashboards for public verifiability

**Why It Matters:**

✅ **Production-Ready**: 95 tests passing, 95.3% coverage, W3C compliant
✅ **Standards-Based**: Built on W3C DID Core, VC Data Model, Status List 2021
✅ **No Blockchain Required**: Works with DNS-based DIDs (though supports blockchain)
✅ **EU AI Act Compliant**: Transparency, auditability, human oversight built-in
✅ **High Performance**: <50ms resolution, <5ms scoring, <1ms revocation checks

**Personal Journey:**

This has been the most challenging and rewarding project of my career. Starting with zero development background, I:
- Learned TypeScript from scratch
- Implemented complex W3C specifications
- Built 313+ comprehensive test files
- Achieved production-grade quality ratings (9.5/10)

I'm now applying to Y Combinator with this technology and would love to hear from:

🎯 **AI/ML Engineers** building multi-agent systems
🎯 **Compliance Officers** dealing with EU AI Act requirements
🎯 **Enterprise Architects** designing trust infrastructure
🎯 **Investors** interested in trust/identity/AI infrastructure

**Try It Now:**

📦 NPM: `npm install @yseeku/trust-protocol`
📖 GitHub: https://github.com/s8ken/SYMBI-Symphony
🎮 Live Demo: https://symbi-synergy-pa9k82n5m-ycq.vercel.app
