## Integration Scenario

### E-Commerce Copilot with Trust

**Without SYMBI**:
```typescript
// Algolia Agent Studio only
const agent = new AlgoliaAgent({
  search: hybridSearch,
  tools: [inventoryLookup, pricingAPI],
  model: 'gpt-4'
});

// Agent can search and orchestrate
await agent.query("Find winter jackets under $100");
// ❌ But can't prove: Who is this agent? What permissions does it have?
```

**With SYMBI + Algolia**:
```typescript
import { AlgoliaAgent } from '@algolia/agent-studio';
import { AgentFactory, trustValidator } from '@yseeku/trust-protocol';

// Create agent with verifiable identity
const agent = new AlgoliaAgent({
  search: hybridSearch,
  tools: [inventoryLookup, pricingAPI],
  model: 'gpt-4'
});

// Issue trust declaration
const trustDeclaration = AgentFactory.createTrustDeclaration(
  agent.id,
  'EcommerceAssistant',
  {
    inspection_mandate: true,
    consent_architecture: true,
    ethical_override: true
  }
);

// Now agent has:
// ✅ Smart retrieval (Algolia)
// ✅ Verifiable identity (SYMBI DID)
// ✅ Trust score (SYMBI credentials)
// ✅ Audit trail (SYMBI cryptographic logs)

// Inter-agent trust check
if (await trustValidator.verifyCredential(partnerAgent.credential)) {
  await agent.shareInventoryData(partnerAgent);
}
```

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Customer Support Agent

**Algolia Provides**:
- Search across knowledge base, CRM, ticket history
- Orchestrate tools (create ticket, escalate, refund)
- Trace decisions for debugging

**SYMBI Provides**:
- Agent identity: "This is Support Agent #A127"
- Permissions: "Agent A127 can refund up to $500"
- Audit: Cryptographic proof of what agent did and why
- Revocation: If agent compromised, revoke credentials instantly

**Result**: Support agent that's both **smart** (Algolia) and **accountable** (SYMBI).

---

### Scenario 2: Multi-Agent Marketplace

**Algolia Provides**:
- Each agent can search marketplace inventory
- Tool orchestration for bidding, purchasing
- Observability across agent fleet

**SYMBI Provides**:
- Each agent has portable DID (works across marketplaces)
- Trust scores (agents verify each other before transacting)
- Revocation (ban fraudulent agents across ecosystem)
- Audit trails (prove transaction legitimacy)

**Result**: Marketplace where agents **find** what they need (Algolia) and **trust** who they're dealing with (SYMBI).

---

### Scenario 3: Enterprise Multi-Agent System

**Algolia Provides**:
- Agents search internal docs, databases, APIs
- Orchestrate workflows across departments
- A/B test agent performance

**SYMBI Provides**:
- Each agent has verifiable role/permissions
- Inter-department trust verification
- EU AI Act compliance (audit trails, transparency)
- Zero-trust architecture (continuous verification)

**Result**: Enterprise where agents **know what to do** (Algolia) and **prove they're authorized** (SYMBI).
