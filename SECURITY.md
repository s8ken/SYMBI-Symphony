## Security Best Practices

When using Symphony:

1. **Key Management:**
   - Always use enterprise KMS in production
   - Rotate keys according to your security policy
   - Never commit private keys to version control

2. **DID Methods:**
   - Use `did:web` for production (DNS-based security)
   - Use `did:key` only for testing (ephemeral)
   - Consider `did:ion` for maximum decentralization

3. **Credential Verification:**
   - Always verify credential signatures
   - Check revocation status before trusting
   - Validate issuer DIDs

4. **Network Security:**
   - Use HTTPS for all DID resolution
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

## Dependencies

We regularly audit our dependencies for vulnerabilities:

```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```

Critical vulnerabilities are patched within 24 hours.

## Compliance

Symphony is designed to support:
- **EU AI Act:** Transparency, auditability, human oversight
