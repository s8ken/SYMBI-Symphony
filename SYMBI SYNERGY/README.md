## 💡 The Problem: Enterprise AI is a Black Box

- **Regulators ask**: "Can you prove your AI isn't discriminating? Show us the audit trail."
- **Boards ask**: "How do we know our AI is working correctly? What's our liability exposure?"
- **Customers ask**: "Why should we trust this AI decision? How do we know it's not biased?"

**Without SYMBI, you're flying blind with billions at risk.** EU AI Act fines start at €35M. One biased AI decision can destroy customer trust.

> **⚖️ [EU AI Act Compliance Ready →](docs/EU_AI_ACT_COMPLIANCE.md)** - 95% compliant, full certification Q1 2025
