   - **Severity:** Moderate
   - **CVSS Score:** 6.5
   - **Affected Package:** webpack-dev-server
   - **Advisory:** [GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h)
   - **Impact:** Source code may be stolen when accessing malicious websites with non-Chromium browsers

3. **webpack-dev-server Source Code Exposure (General)**
   - **Severity:** Moderate
   - **CVSS Score:** 5.3
   - **Affected Package:** webpack-dev-server
   - **Advisory:** [GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v)
   - **Impact:** Source code may be stolen when accessing malicious websites

## Risk Assessment

### Development Environment Risk
- **Impact:** Medium to High
- **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
- **Overall Risk:** Medium

The vulnerabilities primarily affect the development environment through webpack-dev-server and build tools. In production, the built application would not include these vulnerable development dependencies.

### Production Environment Risk
- **Impact:** Low
- **Likelihood:** Low
- **Overall Risk:** Low

Most vulnerabilities are in development dependencies and would not affect the production build.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Monitor for react-scripts Updates**
   - Current version: 5.0.1
   - Latest available: 5.0.1
   - The vulnerabilities require breaking changes to fix
   - Monitor for newer versions that address these issues

2. **Development Environment Security**
   - Ensure developers only access trusted websites while running the development server
   - Consider using Chromium-based browsers during development
   - Implement network isolation for development environments

### Medium-Term Actions

1. **Dependency Management Strategy**
   - Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Set up alerts for new security advisories
   - Regular dependency audits (monthly)

2. **Alternative Build Tools Evaluation**
   - Consider migrating to Vite or other modern build tools
   - Evaluate Create React App alternatives that may have better security posture

### Long-Term Actions

1. **Security Monitoring**
   - Implement Dependabot or similar automated dependency updates
   - Set up security scanning in GitHub Actions
   - Regular security audits (quarterly)

2. **Development Practices**
   - Security-first dependency selection
   - Regular security training for development team
   - Implement security review process for new dependencies

## Mitigation Strategies

### Current Workarounds

1. **Development Environment Isolation**
   ```bash
   # Run development server with restricted network access
   npm start -- --host 127.0.0.1
   ```

2. **Browser Security**
   - Use Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge) during development
   - Avoid accessing untrusted websites while development server is running

### Future Fixes

1. **Force Update (Breaking Changes)**
   ```bash
   # WARNING: This may break the application
   npm audit fix --force
   ```
   **Note:** This is not recommended without thorough testing as it may install react-scripts@0.0.0

2. **Manual Dependency Updates**
   - Wait for react-scripts updates that address these vulnerabilities
   - Consider ejecting from Create React App for more control over dependencies

## Compliance and Standards

- **OWASP Top 10:** No critical issues identified
- **CWE Classifications:** CWE-346, CWE-749 identified
- **CVSS Scores:** Range from 5.3 to 6.5 (Medium severity)

## Conclusion

While the Symbi Synergy platform has several security vulnerabilities in its frontend dependencies, the risk to production environments is relatively low. The vulnerabilities primarily affect the development environment and build tools. The backend is secure with no identified vulnerabilities.

**Recommended Action:** Continue monitoring for updates to react-scripts and implement the suggested mitigation strategies for the development environment.

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this security audit report
2. Implement immediate mitigation strategies
3. Schedule regular security audits
4. Monitor for dependency updates
5. Consider long-term architectural changes if vulnerabilities persist
