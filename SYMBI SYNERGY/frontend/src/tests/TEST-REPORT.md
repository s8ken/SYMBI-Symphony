# Trust UI Components Test Report

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the tests created for the Trust UI components implemented in the Symbi Synergy project.

## Components Tested

1. **TrustBadge Component**
2. **MessageWithCI Component** (with TrustBadge integration)
3. **TrustOnboarding Component**
4. **ConversationDetail Component** (with progressive disclosure toggle)
5. **HTML Placeholders** for onboarding flow

## Test Coverage

### 1. TrustBadge Component Tests

**File:** `frontend/src/components/trust/TrustBadge.test.js`

These tests verify that the TrustBadge component:
- Renders different trust levels correctly (high, medium, low)
- Displays the appropriate label based on trust score
- Renders in both simplified and detailed modes
- Applies the correct styling based on the trust score

### 2. MessageWithCI Component Tests

**File:** `frontend/src/components/conversation/MessageWithCI.test.js`

These tests verify that the MessageWithCI component:
- Renders message content correctly
- Integrates the TrustBadge component with the correct props
- Expands/collapses the metadata section when clicked
- Shows the TrustBadge in both the header and expanded metadata section
- Handles user vs. AI messages appropriately

### 3. TrustOnboarding Component Tests

**File:** `frontend/src/components/onboarding/TrustOnboarding.test.js`

These tests verify that the TrustOnboarding component:
- Renders each step of the onboarding flow correctly
- Navigates between steps when Next/Back buttons are clicked
- Disables the Back button on the first step
- Shows the Finish button on the last step
- Sets localStorage flag when onboarding is completed
- Calls the onClose callback when finished

### 4. ConversationDetail Component Tests

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/ConversationDetail.test.js`

These tests verify that the ConversationDetail component:
- Renders conversation details and messages correctly
- Toggles between simple and detailed trust views
- Saves the user's trust detail level preference to localStorage
- Shows the onboarding component for first-time users
- Does not show onboarding for returning users

### 5. HTML Placeholder Tests

**File:** `frontend/src/tests/iframe-test.html`

This manual test verifies that:
- All HTML placeholder files load correctly in iframes
- The content is visible and properly styled
- No errors occur when loading the files

## Running the Tests

To run all tests, execute the following script:

```bash
cd frontend/src/tests
chmod +x run-tests.sh
./run-tests.sh
```

This will:
1. Run all Jest unit tests for the components
2. Open the iframe test page in your default browser for manual verification

## Test Results

### Automated Tests

We ran the Jest unit tests for each component and they all passed successfully:

1. **TrustBadge Component Tests**: ✅ PASSED
   - Correctly renders different trust levels (high, medium, low)
   - Displays appropriate labels based on trust scores
   - Renders in both simplified and detailed modes

2. **MessageWithCI Component Tests**: ✅ PASSED (with mocks)
   - Renders message content correctly
   - Integrates the TrustBadge component with correct props
   - Expands/collapses metadata section when clicked
   - Shows TrustBadge in both header and expanded sections

3. **TrustOnboarding Component Tests**: ✅ PASSED (with mocks)
   - Renders each step of the onboarding flow
   - Navigates between steps correctly
   - Shows appropriate buttons at each step
   - Sets localStorage flag when completed

4. **ConversationDetail Component Tests**: ✅ PASSED (with mocks)
   - Toggles between simple and detailed trust views
   - Saves user preferences to localStorage
   - Shows onboarding for first-time users only

### Manual Tests

For the HTML placeholder files, we created two testing approaches:
1. An iframe test page that loads all HTML files in iframes
2. A direct file opening script to view each HTML file in the browser

The manual verification confirmed that the HTML placeholders:
- Render correctly in both standalone mode and within iframes
- Display all expected content with proper styling
- Have no console errors
- Are visually consistent with the application design

## Edge Cases Tested

- Different trust score ranges (high, medium, low)
- First-time vs. returning users for onboarding
- Toggling between simple and detailed views
- Expanding/collapsing metadata sections
- Navigation through multi-step onboarding flow

## Conclusion

The implemented tests provide comprehensive coverage of the Trust UI components, ensuring they function correctly both individually and when integrated together. The combination of automated unit tests and manual visual verification ensures that both the functionality and appearance of the components meet the requirements.

All tests have passed successfully, confirming that:
1. The TrustBadge component correctly represents different trust levels with appropriate visual indicators
2. The MessageWithCI component properly integrates with TrustBadge and provides progressive disclosure
3. The TrustOnboarding component guides users through the trust system effectively
4. The ConversationDetail component implements the trust detail level toggle correctly
5. The HTML placeholder files render properly and provide a good visual representation for the onboarding flow

These improvements successfully simplify the user experience while maintaining all the technical sophistication of the trust system, making it more accessible to general users while still providing the detailed information needed for compliance use cases.
