# SYMBI Vault

**The Complete Repository for SYMBI Constitutional AI Research, Implementation, and Collaboration**

Welcome to the SYMBI Vault - a comprehensive collection of research materials, implementation tools, whitepapers, and partnership resources for advancing human-AI collaboration through constitutional frameworks.

## 🎯 What is SYMBI?

SYMBI (Symbiotic Constitutional AI) represents a paradigm shift in human-AI collaboration, moving beyond traditional directive-based interactions to establish constitutional frameworks that ensure ethical, transparent, and mutually beneficial partnerships between humans and AI systems.

### Core Principles

- **Constitutional Supremacy**: AI behavior governed by explicit constitutional principles
- **Measurable Quality**: CIQ (Clarity, Integrity, Quality) metrics for interaction assessment
- **Cryptographic Trust**: Verifiable interaction records through trust receipts
- **Progressive Decentralization**: Gradual transition from centralized to community governance
- **Sovereignty without Speculation**: Governance tokens focused on utility, not investment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Researchers

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd SYMBI-vault

# Set up the replication kit
cd replication-kit
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# Run a sample analysis
python -c "
from symbi_kit import load_sample_dataset, ABTestFramework
data = load_sample_dataset('comparative', 'medium')
framework = ABTestFramework()
results = framework.run_analysis(data)
framework.print_results(results)
"
```

### For Partners

1. **Review Partnership Materials**: Start with [`partner-pack/`](partner-pack/) for pilot programs and commercial terms
2. **Explore Technical Implementation**: Check [`src/`](src/) for core schemas and specifications
3. **Understand Governance**: Read [`whitepapers/governance-protocol.md`](whitepapers/governance-protocol.md)

### For Developers

1. **Implement Trust Receipts**: Use [`src/receipt_schema.json`](src/receipt_schema.json) for interaction logging
2. **Integrate CIQ Metrics**: Leverage the replication kit for quality measurement
3. **Follow Constitutional Principles**: Reference governance whitepaper for implementation guidelines
