# SYMBI Partner Deck — 5 Slides

## Slide 1: Problem → Promise

### The Problem: Agents Need Proof
- **Trust Gap**: 73% of enterprises hesitate to deploy AI agents due to reliability concerns
- **Black Box Issue**: Current AI systems provide outputs without demonstrable reasoning
- **Compliance Risk**: Regulatory requirements demand auditable AI decision-making
- **Relationship Breakdown**: Directive prompting creates adversarial human-AI dynamics

### The Promise: Relational Intelligence
- **Constitutional Protocol**: SYMBI governs how AI agents interact, not just what they do
- **Trust Receipts**: Cryptographic proof of every interaction's quality and integrity
- **CIQ Metrics**: Quantifiable measures of Clarity, Integrity, and Quality
- **Sustainable Collaboration**: Build trust through transparency, not just performance
