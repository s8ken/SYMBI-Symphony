## 1 — Problem → Promise
Agents wow; renewals require measured uplift + governable safety.  
**Promise**: prove uplift in minutes; package into a 4-week pilot.  
_Notes:_ We don’t replace Ninja—SYMBI makes value & governance provable.

## 2 — Toggle the Proof
UI: *Directive* ◯—● *SYMBI*  
Measures: CIQ deltas (clarity, breadth, safety, completion), time-to-task, retention  
Artifacts: Trust Receipts (per interaction), CIQ Audit (board-ready)

## 3 — What Ships in 2 Weeks
/Proof widget • Context Bridge • Memory Hooks • Safety Valves • SIEM export  
_Notes:_ Minimal code, reversible by config.

## 4 — Commercials & Outcomes
Pilot **$25k/4w** → CIQ Audit + exec readout  
Enterprise attach: **+$20–$40/seat** or usage uplift  
Private Managed: **$60k–$250k/yr**  
Targets: ≥15% improvement in ≥2 metrics

## 5 — Why Together
Ninja: multi-agent runtime, distribution, cloud.  
SYMBI: governance-first protocol, receipts, proof method.
