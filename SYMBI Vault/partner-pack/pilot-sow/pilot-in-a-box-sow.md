# Pilot-in-a-Box — Statement of Work

**Objective**: Achieve measurable uplift in two workflows using SYMBI within Ninja  
**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Investment**: $25,000 for 2 workflows, 1 environment

## Scope

This pilot engagement demonstrates SYMBI's relational intelligence capabilities through systematic implementation and measurement across two representative enterprise workflows. Success is defined as ≥15% improvement in ≥2 key metrics or signed renewal commitment.

## Weekly Activities

### Week 1: Baseline & Instrument
- **Workflow Analysis**: Document current state of 2 target workflows
- **Baseline Metrics**: Establish performance benchmarks using existing tools
- **Instrumentation Setup**: Deploy SYMBI measurement infrastructure
- **Team Onboarding**: Train 3-5 pilot users on SYMBI protocol

**Deliverables**: Baseline report, instrumentation confirmation

### Week 2: Enable SYMBI
- **Protocol Integration**: Implement SYMBI constitutional framework
- **Trust Receipt Generation**: Begin capturing CIQ metrics
- **Initial Training**: Conduct workflow-specific SYMBI training
- **Early Feedback**: Collect user experience data

**Deliverables**: SYMBI integration confirmation, initial usage data

### Week 3: Optimize
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjust SYMBI parameters based on usage patterns
- **Advanced Features**: Enable context bridging and memory hooks
- **User Coaching**: Provide targeted coaching for optimal adoption
- **Metric Collection**: Gather comprehensive performance data

**Deliverables**: Optimization report, mid-pilot metrics

### Week 4: Prove & Package
- **Final Measurement**: Complete performance assessment vs. baseline
- **ROI Analysis**: Calculate business impact and efficiency gains
- **Documentation**: Package learnings and best practices
- **Executive Presentation**: Deliver results and recommendations

**Deliverables**: Final results report, executive presentation deck

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Proof Widget
Interactive dashboard showing real-time CIQ improvements and workflow performance metrics

### 2. CIQ Audit
Comprehensive analysis of Clarity, Integrity, and Quality improvements across pilot workflows

### 3. Receipts Archive
Complete Trust Receipt collection demonstrating interaction quality and compliance

### 4. Executive Deck
Strategic presentation of results, ROI analysis, and scaling recommendations

## Commercials

- **Base Pilot**: $25,000 (2 workflows, 1 environment, 4 weeks)
- **Additional Workflows**: +$7,500 per workflow
- **Private Managed POC**: $30,000 (enhanced support and customization)

## Success Metrics

**Primary Success Criteria** (must achieve one):
- ≥15% improvement in ≥2 quantitative metrics (efficiency, accuracy, user satisfaction)
- Signed renewal or expansion commitment

**Secondary Metrics**:
- CIQ score improvements (target: +20% composite)
- User adoption rate (target: >80% active usage)
- Trust Receipt generation consistency (target: >95%)

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- **BYO Keys**: Customer maintains cryptographic key control
- **No PII Exfiltration**: Personal data remains within customer environment
- **SIEM Export**: All interactions logged to customer security systems
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for SYMBI components

### Audit & Compliance
- Complete audit trail via Trust Receipts
- Retention controls aligned with customer policies
- Regional hosting options available
- DPA/SOC2/ISO compliance roadmap provided

## IP & Terms

- **Non-Custodial**: Customer retains full data ownership
- **Open Source Components**: Core protocol available under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
- **Commercial License**: Pilot includes commercial usage rights
- **No Lock-in**: Customer can continue using open source version post-pilot

## Next Steps

1. **Kickoff Call**: Schedule within 48 hours of SOW signature
2. **Environment Access**: Provide Ninja system access and user accounts
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Confirm executive sponsor and pilot team
4. **Success Criteria**: Finalize specific metrics and measurement methodology
