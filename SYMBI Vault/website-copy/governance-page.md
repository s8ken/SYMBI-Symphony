# Governance
**Sovereignty without speculation.** Points now. Token later—**governance only**, no rights to profits, no sale.

## Why governance exists
We optimize collaboration quality, safety, and public goods. Governance lets contributors and operators steer the protocol without pay-to-play.

## How decisions are made
- **House of Work:** reputation-weighted signaling from non-transferable attestations.
- **House of Stewardship:** time-bound steward council; narrow veto on constitution/budget/security.
- **Safeguards:** timelocks, emergency sunset, transparent budgets.

## Reputation, not speculation
Earn non-transferable reputation via Trust Receipts and CIQ outcomes. It unlocks proposal power; it cannot be sold.

## Token (optional, future)
If introduced, $SYMBI has **no** profit rights or redemption; parameter votes + quality staking only. Payments stay in fiat/stablecoins.

## Road to sovereignty
Institute guardianship → dual-house governance → on-chain execution → independent security council.
