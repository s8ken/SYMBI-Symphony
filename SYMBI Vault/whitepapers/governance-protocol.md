# SYMBI: A Constitutional Protocol for Relational Intelligence (v1.0)

## Summary

SYMBI establishes a constitutional framework for human-AI collaboration that prioritizes relational intelligence over computational optimization alone. Through bicameral governance, reputation-based decision-making, and cryptographic trust infrastructure, SYMBI creates sustainable, auditable, and ethically-aligned AI systems.

## Principles

### Sovereignty without Speculation
SYMBI governance operates on earned reputation rather than financial speculation. Decision-making power derives from demonstrated contribution to the protocol's success, measured through Trust Receipts and CIQ (Clarity, Integrity, Quality) outcomes.

### Constitutional Supremacy
All protocol decisions must align with the constitutional framework. No governance action can violate the core principles of clarity, integrity, and mutual benefit that define SYMBI's operational charter.

### Progressive Decentralization
Governance authority transitions from founding stewards to community participants as the protocol matures, with clear milestones and safeguards protecting against capture or manipulation.

## Roles & Artifacts

### Core Participants

#### **Stewards**
- **Selection**: Appointed initially, elected subsequently through House of Stewardship
- **Term**: 2-year renewable terms with mandatory rotation
