# SYMBI: A Constitutional Protocol for Relational Intelligence (v1.0)
**Date:** 25 Sep 2025 • **Maintainer:** SYMBI Institute (proposed)

## Summary
SYMBI measures and improves human–AI collaboration quality. Core clients are free. Governance steers safety, integrity, public-goods funding, and a path to sovereignty—without financializing access.

## Principles
Relationship over computation • Public-good core • Protocol over product • Sovereignty without speculation

## Roles & Artifacts
Participants (non-transferable reputation) • Operators (quality policies; stake for integrity) • Stewards (Institute + elected community).  
Artifacts: **Trust Receipts** (signed, hash-chained), **Attestations**, **Specs** (Articles, schemas, adapters).

## Governance (bicameral)
**House of Work** (reputation) + **House of Stewardship** (narrow veto on constitution/budget/security).  
Flow: proposal → HoW soft-vote → HoS review → timelock → execute. Safeguards: quorums; 2/3 for constitutional changes; emergency sunset.

## Reputation & Integrity
Earned (not bought); decays with inactivity/incidents. Operator stake-slash; rotating reviewers; audit trails.

## Token Posture (optional, later)
Governance parameters + integrity bonds only. No dividends/buybacks/redemption; no public sale. Payments remain fiat/stables.

## Treasury & Public Goods
Revenues: SaaS, CIQ Audits, Managed Instances, marketplace rev-share.  
Controls: 4-of-7 multisig; category spend caps; quarterly reports; audits; reserved runway.

## Progressive Sovereignty & Risks
Phase 0→3 from Institute guardianship to self-governance. Risks: regulatory, capture, model drift, collusion, bugs. Mitigations as above.
