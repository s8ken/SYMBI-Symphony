## Integration Components

### 1. TrustOracle Bridge Service
Located at `src/integration/trust-oracle-bridge.ts`

This service connects SYMBI Vault's constitutional compliance evaluation with the operational components of Tactical Command:

- **Action Evaluation**: Evaluates all agent actions against the 7 constitutional principles
- **Trust Scoring**: Updates and maintains trust scores for all agents based on compliance
- **Compliance Reporting**: Generates detailed constitutional compliance reports
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors agents for violations

### 2. Unified Agent Orchestrator
Located at `src/integration/unified-agent-orchestrator.ts`

This service creates a unified layer between Symphony's orchestration capabilities and Tactical Command's agent management:

- **Agent Registration**: Registers agents in both Symphony and Tactical systems
- **Message Routing**: Routes messages between agents with trust validation
- **Task Execution**: Executes tasks with constitutional compliance checking
- **Status Management**: Provides unified status across both systems

### 3. Unified Trust Dashboard
Located at `Tactical Command/components/ui/unified-trust-dashboard.tsx`

This component provides a real-time interface for monitoring agent trust and constitutional compliance:

- **Trust Visualization**: Displays trust scores and bands for all agents
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Shows real-time compliance with constitutional principles
- **Violation Alerts**: Flags constitutional violations with severity indicators
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks trust score trends over time

### 4. Trust Bridge API
Located at `Tactical Command/app/api/trust-bridge/route.ts`

RESTful API endpoints that enable communication between components:

- **POST Endpoints**: For action evaluation, trust score updates, and compliance reporting
- **GET Endpoints**: For retrieving trust statistics and agent compliance status

## How Components Fit Into the Overall Solution
