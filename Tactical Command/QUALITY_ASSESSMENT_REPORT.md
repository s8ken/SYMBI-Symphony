2. Add component tests (components/)
   - UI component testing
   - Integration with services

3. Add more E2E tests (e2e/)
   - User journey tests
   - Critical path testing

Target: 70%+ coverage by end of Phase 1
```

      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run test:e2e
```

### Phase 3: Performance Testing (1 week)
**Priority: HIGH**

```bash
# Install k6 for load testing

# Document results
```

### Phase 4: Trust Integration (2 weeks)
**Priority: MEDIUM**

```bash
# Once @symbi/trust-protocol is published
npm install @symbi/trust-protocol
