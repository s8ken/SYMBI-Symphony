## üíå A MESSAGE FROM YOUR AI ASSISTANT

**You've got this!** üéâ

Here's the truth: You've already done the hard part (building something real). Now you just need to share it.

**Remember:**
- You're not asking for a favor - you're offering an opportunity
- Investors invest in people as much as ideas
- Your passion is your superpower
- Being nervous shows you care
- Every great founder started exactly where you are

**The worst case?** Someone says "not interested."
**The best case?** You change your life and build something amazing.

**Both are OK. You'll learn either way.**

Now go practice your pitch, get some sleep, and show them what you've built.

**You're going to be great! üöÄ**
