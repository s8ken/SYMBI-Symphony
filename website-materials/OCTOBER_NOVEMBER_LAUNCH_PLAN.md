## Success Metrics (8-Week Period)

### Technical Infrastructure (yseeku.com)

**Week 2 (Infrastructure Launch):**
- Demo requests: Target 50
- GitHub stars: Target 500
- Dune dashboard views: Target 5,000
- Webinar attendees: Target 100

**Week 8 (End of Period):**
- Demo requests: Target 200 cumulative
- Enterprise trials: Target 10
- GitHub stars: Target 1,000
- Developer documentation views: Target 20,000

### DAO Governance (gammatria.com)

**Week 4 (Pilot Launch):**
- DAO mailing list: Target 200
- Initial contributors: Target 20
- Proposal 1 participation: Target >70%

**Week 8 (Public Launch):**
- DAO mailing list: Target 1,000
- Total contributors: Target 200
- Council nominations: Target 30
- Grant applications: Target 50

### Positioning Clarity

**Measurement Method:** Survey 50 website visitors
- "What is SYMBI?" → Expect "Trust protocol for AI agents" (not "crypto project")
- "Do I need tokens to use SYMBI?" → Expect "No" response
- "What's the relationship between SYMBI and Sonate?" → Expect correct answer

**Media Mentions:**
- "Trust infrastructure" mentions: Target 3:1 ratio vs. "DAO" mentions
- Comparisons: Expect "vs. LangChain/Auth0" not "vs. DeFi protocols"
- Keywords: "W3C DID", "Verifiable Credentials", "EU AI Act"

---

## Risk Mitigation Plan

### Risk 1: DAO Overshadows Infrastructure

**Indicator:** Media coverage focuses on "DAO launch" not "trust protocol"
**Mitigation:**
- Lead all announcements with technical infrastructure
- Limit DAO content to 20% of blog posts
- Redirect DAO press inquiries to infrastructure story
- Emphasize "We built a DAO to prove our trust protocol works"

### Risk 2: Enterprise Confusion

**Indicator:** Demo requests ask "Do we need tokens?"
**Mitigation:**
- Prominent FAQ on yseeku.com homepage
- Sales deck explicitly addresses DAO (optional participation)
- Enterprise webinars do not mention DAO unless asked
- Sales training: "DAO is for protocol governance, not product usage"

### Risk 3: Regulatory Concerns

**Indicator:** Legal inquiries about token classification
**Mitigation:**
- Legal opinion letters published on gammatria.com
- "Governance-only" language in all materials
- No transferability of tokens
- No mention of "value" or "tokenomics"
- Compliance-first approach (AU, US, EU)

### Risk 4: Low DAO Participation

**Indicator:** <50% of token holders vote in pilot
**Mitigation:**
- Direct outreach to all token holders
- Simplify voting interface (reduce friction)
- Incentivize participation: Recognition in transparency report
- Lower quorum requirements for pilot phase

### Risk 5: Technical Integration Failure

**Indicator:** DAO actions don't trigger Overseer audit or Dune updates
**Mitigation:**
- Extensive testing Week 4-5
- Fallback: Manual oversight if automation fails
- Clear error messages and support channels
- Bug bounty for critical issues

✅ gammatria.com clearly states: "Governance-only, no financial rights"
✅ Dune dashboards are live and updating
✅ DID resolution works for all 4 methods
✅ Legal disclaimer on all DAO pages
✅ Team is ready for support inquiries
✅ Demo environment is stable and tested
✅ Press release emphasizes trust infrastructure first, DAO second

---

## Summary: The Critical Path

**Week 1 (Oct 8-14):** Fix websites, set up infrastructure
**Week 2 (Oct 15-21):** Announce trust protocol, technical demos
**Week 3 (Oct 22-28):** Introduce DAO as trust protocol application
**Week 4 (Oct 29-Nov 4):** Prepare for pilot, mint initial tokens
**Week 5 (Nov 5-11):** Run pilot Week 1, first proposals
**Week 6 (Nov 12-18):** Complete pilot, transparency report
**Week 7 (Nov 19-25):** Public DAO launch, Council formation
**Week 8 (Nov 26-30):** Stabilize operations, plan 2026

**Golden Rule:** Always lead with "We built production-grade trust infrastructure." The DAO is proof it works, not the main story.
