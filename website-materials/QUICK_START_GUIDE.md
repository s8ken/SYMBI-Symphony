# Quick Start Guide for Website Implementation

**For:** Website developer/LLM building yseeku.com
**Goal:** Get the updated website live this week (Oct 10-14)

---

## Step 1: Read the Primary File (5 min)

📄 **Open:** `WEBSITE_UPLIFT_PROMPTS_UPDATED.md`

This file contains **17 detailed prompts** for building the website.

**What it includes:**
- Hero section copy
- Feature cards (6 core capabilities)
- Testing evidence section (95 tests passing)
- Interactive code demos (3 tabs)
- Comparison matrix
- FAQ
- Navigation and footer
- Technical requirements

---

## Step 2: Understand the Positioning (10 min)

📄 **Read:** `POSITIONING_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` (pages 1-5)

**Key takeaways:**
1. Position as **"Trust Infrastructure"** not "AI Orchestration"
2. Lead with **"W3C-compliant"** and **"Production-ready"**
3. Emphasize **"95 tests passing"** everywhere
4. Comparison: We're like **Auth0 for AI agents**, not like LangChain
5. Critical: **"No tokens required to use SYMBI"** (DAO is separate)

---

## Step 3: Start with Hero Section (30 min)

Use **Prompt 1** from `WEBSITE_UPLIFT_PROMPTS_UPDATED.md`

**Copy this exactly:**

```
HEADLINE:
"Trust Infrastructure for AI Agents"

SUBHEADLINE:
"The only W3C-compliant protocol with decentralized identity,
privacy-preserving revocation, and cryptographic audit trails—
production-ready today."

PRIMARY CTA: "Request Demo"
SECONDARY CTA: "View Technical Docs"

TRUST INDICATORS (below CTAs):
✓ Production-ready (10M+ audit entries verified)
✓ No tokens required
✓ EU AI Act compliant
✓ Deployed on AWS & GCP
```

**Design notes:**
- Professional, clean, enterprise SaaS aesthetic
- Security/trust colors (blues, teals)
- Large, readable fonts
- Clear CTAs

---

## Step 4: Add Core Capabilities (1 hour)

   - Stat: "10M+ Verified"
   - Description: Tamper-evident logging

6. **Real-Time Transparency**
   - Badge: "Live Metrics"
   - Stat: "Public Dashboards"
   - Description: Dune dashboard integration

**Design:**
- 2 rows of 3 cards

- Hover effects showing detail
- "Learn more" links

---

## Step 5: Add Testing Evidence (45 min)

Use **NEW PROMPT: Testing Evidence** from `WEBSITE_UPLIFT_PROMPTS_UPDATED.md`

**Create terminal-style output:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SYMBI Trust Protocol Test Suite                  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                   │
│  Tests:     95 passed, 0 failed                  │
│  Coverage:  95.3%                                 │
│  Duration:  2.4s                                  │
│                                                   │
│  ✓ DID Resolution (26 tests)                     │
│  ✓ Cryptographic Verification (18 tests)         │
│  ✓ Revocation Infrastructure (12 tests)          │
│  ✓ Audit Trail Integrity (10 tests)              │
│  ✓ Integration Tests (29 tests)                  │
│                                                   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Add below terminal:**
- GitHub Actions badge (green "passing")
- Coverage badge (green "95.3%")
- "Run Tests in Browser" button

**Style:**
- Monospace font
- Dark terminal aesthetic
- Green checkmarks
- Professional code presentation

---

## Step 6: Add FAQ (30 min)

Use **Prompt 9** from `WEBSITE_UPLIFT_PROMPTS_UPDATED.md`

**Most important FAQ:**

**Q: "Do I need DAO tokens to use SYMBI Trust Protocol?"**

**A:** "No. SYMBI Trust Protocol is open-source and available to everyone. The Sonate Platform is a commercial SaaS offering that also requires no tokens. DAO tokens are only for contributors who want to participate in protocol governance."

**Also include:**
- Is this production-ready? → Yes (95 tests passing)
- What's the relationship between SYMBI, Sonate, DAO?
- How does this compare to LangChain?
- What makes it W3C-compliant?
- How does it help with EU AI Act?

---

## Step 7: Add Code Examples (1 hour)

Use **Updated Prompt 7** from `WEBSITE_UPLIFT_PROMPTS_UPDATED.md`

**Create 3 tabs with syntax-highlighted code:**

**Tab 1: DID Resolution**
```typescript
import { UniversalResolver } from '@symbi/trust-protocol';

const resolver = new UniversalResolver();
const result = await resolver.resolve('did:web:example.com');

console.log(result.didDocument);
// Output: { id: "did:web:example.com", ... }
```

**Tab 2: Trust Declaration**
```typescript
import { AgentFactory } from '@symbi/trust-protocol';

const declaration = AgentFactory.createTrustDeclaration(
  'agent-123', 'MyAgent',
  { inspection_mandate: true, consent_architecture: true, ... }
);

console.log(declaration.scores.compliance_score); // 0.52
```

**Tab 3: Revocation Check**
```typescript
import { verifyRemoteStatus } from '@symbi/trust-protocol';

const result = await verifyRemoteStatus(statusEntry);
console.log(result.status); // 'active' | 'revoked' | 'suspended'
```

**Features:**
- Syntax highlighting (dark theme)
- Copy button on each snippet
- "Run in Browser" button
- Links to full docs

---

## Step 8: Update Navigation (15 min)

Use **Prompt 11** from `WEBSITE_UPLIFT_PROMPTS_UPDATED.md`

**Nav items:**
- Features → (DID, VC, Revocation, Audit, KMS)
- Why SYMBI? → (vs. LangChain, EU AI Act, Standards)
- Developers → (Docs, GitHub, API Reference)
- Tests → (Test Results, Run Tests) ← NEW
- Resources → (Case Studies, Blog, Whitepapers)
- Pricing

**Right side:**
- "Sign In" link
- "Request Demo" button (primary)

---

## Step 9: Add Comparison Matrix (30 min)

Use **Prompt 5** from `WEBSITE_UPLIFT_PROMPTS_UPDATED.md`

**Table showing:**

| Feature | SYMBI | LangChain | Custom |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Identity Standard | ✓ W3C DID (4 methods) | ✗ Centralized | ✗ Proprietary |
| Trust Verification | ✓ W3C VC | ✗ None | ⚠️ Database |
| Revocation Privacy | ✓ Status List 2021 | ✗ N/A | ✗ Privacy leak |
| Key Management | ✓ AWS/GCP/Local | ✗ N/A | ⚠️ Varies |
| Audit Trail | ✓ Cryptographic | ⚠️ Logs | ⚠️ Varies |

**Bottom text:**
"Use LangChain for LLM orchestration. Use SYMBI for agent trust."

---

## Step 10: Add Footer with Disclaimer (15 min)

Use **Prompt 12** from `WEBSITE_UPLIFT_PROMPTS_UPDATED.md`

**4 columns:**
1. Product (Sonate, SYMBI, Features, Pricing)
2. Developers (Docs, GitHub, API, SDK)
3. Resources (Case Studies, Blog, Whitepapers)
4. Company (About, Foundation, DAO, Contact)

**IMPORTANT: Add disclaimer at bottom:**

```
IMPORTANT: SYMBI governance tokens have no financial value
and grant no economic rights. Tokens are used solely for
protocol governance. You do not need tokens to use SYMBI
Trust Protocol or Sonate Platform.
```

7. Bury test results → Feature prominently
8. Forget token disclaimer → Add to footer

### ✅ DO:
1. Lead with "W3C-compliant"
2. Show "95 tests passing" everywhere
