## UPDATED PROMPT 7: Interactive Code Demo (Enhanced)

**Replace the existing Prompt 7 with this enhanced version:**

```
Create a "See It In Action" interactive code section:

SECTION TITLE: "Live Demo: Trust Protocol in Action"
SECTION SUBTITLE: "Try our production-ready infrastructure right in your browser"

TABBED INTERFACE (3 tabs with working code):

Tab 1: "DID Resolution" [DEFAULT SELECTED]
DESCRIPTION: "Resolve decentralized identifiers across 4 methods"

LEFT PANEL (Editable Code):
```typescript
import { UniversalResolver } from '@symbi/trust-protocol';

const resolver = new UniversalResolver();

// Try different DIDs:
// did:web:example.com
// did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK
// did:ethr:0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890

const result = await resolver.resolve('did:web:example.com');

console.log('DID Document:', result.didDocument);
console.log('Resolution time:', result.didResolutionMetadata.duration);
console.log('Method:', result.didDocument.verificationMethod);
```

RIGHT PANEL (Live Output):
```json
{
  "didDocument": {
    "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"],
    "id": "did:web:example.com",
    "verificationMethod": [{
      "id": "did:web:example.com#key-1",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
      "controller": "did:web:example.com",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkhaXgBZ..."
    }]
  },
  "didResolutionMetadata": {
    "duration": 42,
    "cached": false
  }
}
```

BADGES (below code):
✓ Tested: 22 tests passing
✓ Supports: did:web, did:key, did:ethr, did:ion
✓ Performance: <50ms average resolution

Tab 2: "Trust Declaration"
DESCRIPTION: "Issue Verifiable Credentials with 6-pillar trust scoring"

LEFT PANEL (Editable Code):
```typescript
import { AgentFactory } from '@symbi/trust-protocol';

// Toggle trust articles to see score change
const trustDeclaration = AgentFactory.createTrustDeclaration(
  'agent-123',
  'MyAIAgent',
  {
    inspection_mandate: true,
    consent_architecture: true,
    ethical_override: true,
    continuous_validation: false,
    right_to_disconnect: false,
    moral_recognition: false
  }
);

console.log('Compliance Score:',
  trustDeclaration.scores.compliance_score);
console.log('Guilt Score:',
  trustDeclaration.scores.guilt_score);
console.log('Trust Level:',
  trustDeclaration.trust_level);
```

RIGHT PANEL (Live Output):
```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent-123",
  "scores": {
    "compliance_score": 0.52,
    "guilt_score": 0.48,
    "confidence_interval": {
      "lower": 0.48,

};

const result = await verifyRemoteStatus(statusEntry);

console.log('Status:', result.status);
console.log('Checked at:', result.checked);

## Final Checklist for LLM Building Website

When implementing these prompts, ensure:

✅ Test results are visually prominent (terminal aesthetic)
✅ "95 tests passing" appears on homepage
✅ GitHub Actions badge shows live status
✅ Code examples have "Run in Browser" buttons
✅ Every claim is backed by test evidence
✅ Links to test report and GitHub tests directory
✅ Standards compliance table included
✅ Performance numbers shown (not just claims)
✅ "Production-ready" backed by test coverage
✅ Interactive demos use real SYMBI code
✅ Test-first philosophy explained
✅ Comparison table shows testing advantage

**Tone:** Proof-oriented, developer-focused, technically credible, standards-compliant

**Avoid:** Claims without evidence, "coming soon" features, abstract trust language

**Emphasize:** Real tests, real code, real standards validation, run it yourself
